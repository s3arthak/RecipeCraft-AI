        # SmartRecipe Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

        ## Quick start

        1. Install dependencies:

```
cd frontend_vite
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

3. Environment

- For local dev the frontend is configured to call the backend at `http://localhost:4000/api` by default.
- To override for production, create a `.env` file with:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url/api
```

Replace `your-backend-url` with your deployed backend.

Enjoy!
